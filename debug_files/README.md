These files are here for developing the filter.
When I develop, I have three files open: `filter.lua`, whatever org-file I am trying to get right (like `debug_files/option.org`), and `debug_files/filterednative` so that I can inspect the
document structure. I then use make to update `filterednative` and the output as I am working on the filter.
